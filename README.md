code for horizons

basically to use my scanner you edit the text file lang.txt and then you enter any string- this will allow you to evaluate whether or not your string that you entered was valid!

ALSO this was very difficult and informational but also i was the big confused for a lot of this- and i am thankful to those who assisted me
